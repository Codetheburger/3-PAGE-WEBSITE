# 3 page website project 

in this project , I am to create a 3 page website with each page being Landing page, sign up page and a login page respectively.



## Features

- 3 pages 
- login , sign up and landing page.
- for this project each page is going to have it respective files i.e respective html and css files
- So basically , I'm having different html file for each pages and different css files for the styling of each page for easier debugging.
-This files(html and css files) in this case are my base files.
-And to begin the project I'd have to define the structure of my project .
- there are different ways for this.
- But I'd showing 3 ways I'd structure my files using 3 branch.
- Each branch has it own structure on how my files are arranged some in directories others in sub-directories  and some in  the main  repo. (This is the project structure).

-It's basically how my files are arranged.
